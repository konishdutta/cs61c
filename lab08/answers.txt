Exercise 1:
    1. 32
    2. 2, 8, 0, 8
    3. No page hits because the TLB and Frame numbers in memory match. Same size

Exercise 2:
    1. 00, 20, 40, 60, 80, A0, C0, E0, 00, 20

Exercise 3:
    1. Physical Memory Size

Exercise 1 Checkoff Questions:
    1. 1st 3 bits is page number, next 5 bits is offset. we then look up the 1st 3 bits in the TLB and find the corresponding PPN. If that fails, we do the same in the PTE. If that fails, we have a page fault and grab the data from disk and put it in the LRU memory frame. and update PTE and TLB
    2. There are only 4 frames in the PPN, while the virtual memory can hold 8 pages.

Exercise 4 Checkoff Question:
    1.
